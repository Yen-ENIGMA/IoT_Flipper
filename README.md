# IoT_Flipper
Our project is an IoT-based security toolkit built using an ESP32 microcontroller, designed to simulate and demonstrate real-world wireless vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi, RFID, and infrared systems. The core of the system operates through a terminal-style command-line interface, allowing users to perform actions such as Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks, beacon frame flooding, RFID tag scanning and emulation, and IR signal replay (e.g., TV remote control mimicry). The device is structured to be modular and minimal, connecting peripherals like RFID readers, IR transmitters, and LEDs via breadboards and jumper wires.

While the toolkit is fully operable through terminal commands (entered via serial or network interface), we also support an optional Android/Web interface for select features. These interfaces allow users to interact with the ESP32 remotely by scanning Wi-Fi networks or reading RFID/NFC tags using their smartphones, and then sending the collected information to the device. For example, a phone can scan a student ID (via NFC), then transmit the UID to the ESP32 for emulation. Similarly, users can view nearby Wi-Fi SSIDs in the app and instruct the ESP32 to deauthenticate a selected network.

This hybrid design — combining terminal and mobile/web interaction — makes the toolkit versatile for both classroom demonstrations and portable, real-world testing. It offers a compelling view into how common communication protocols can be exploited, providing hands-on experience with penetration testing methods in a controlled, educational setting.
